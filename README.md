# solaris-Weather

A simple weather application that allows users to search their local weather stats by city created with mostly javaScript.  Three different views are available to see current, hourly, and a 5-day forcast.  This app uses TheDarkSky's Forecast API and Skycons icons from https://github.com/darkskyapp.  Thanks to them for putting out such awesome content :]
